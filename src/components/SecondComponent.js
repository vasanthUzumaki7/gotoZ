     <p>An AR Code is designed to be universally rendered without any app on all mobile devices, including AR/VR headsets. Immersive AR rendering is supported on iOS and iPadOS, visionOS, and Android devices with Google Play Services for AR. Older Android mobile devices will have access to WebAR rendering using A-Frame technology with an AR marker. Additionally, AR Codes support advanced features such as AR Face Filters, AI Codes, and AR Videos, enhancing the interactive experience across a wide range of compatible smartphone devices.</p>
